# Dependencies
For generating the histories it works with: https://github.com/FireChickenProductivity/BAR

Provides actions used by some of the commands it generates: https://github.com/FireChickenProductivity/ActionsForGeneratedCommands

# Usage
Execute the python script: basic_action_record_analysis.py in the src folder.

You give it a path to the history to analyze after the programme starts running.

The program generates a Recommendations directory outputting each set of recommendations in a text file. It will output some statistics proceeded by a # and the actions for every recommended command. 

# State of the Project
This is a prototype with significant room for improvement. I personally find this useful, but it currently generates excessive recommendations.
